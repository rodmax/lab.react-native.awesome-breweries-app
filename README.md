# React Native Awesome Breweries App

## Key notes

-   application developed and tested only on real android device in development mode using android-studio
-   Architecture design borrowed from https://github.com/rodmax/react-playground/blob/master/docs/application-structure.md
    and is rather opinionated than recommended
-   Status:
    -   ✅ List with infinite scroll
    -   ✅ Text search
    -   ✅ open details modal when click to item
    -   ⚠️ view part of application(layout,styles,components) - so-so :( too much _StackOverflow_ approach without fundamental understanding
    -   🟥 advanced filter: not implemented yet.
        It seems the logic should be similar to search by text: button, modal form, dispatch filterChange event, reload data
    -   🟥 not considered at all:
        -   performance(redux,rxjs is good choice for mobile?)
        -   cross-platform
        -   production build & deploy
        -   and some more...
